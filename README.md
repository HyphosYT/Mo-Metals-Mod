# First Fabric Mod
This is my first fabric mod that will eventually and hopefully have titanium. Titanium can be used to create armour, tools, and blocks. It can be obtained from ore that will spawn underground and be mined with a pickaxe.

## Downloading
If you are looking for the release (.jar mod) [go here](https://github.com/HyphosYT/first-fabric-mod/releases) and download the newest one or the one that you want.

## Contributing
While blindly submitting Pull Requests is definetally an option, providing a good description to what you are changing will provide and much greater chance you get accepted.

I am not looking for flashy features, but expanding upon the existing feature set without distruption or endangering future viability of the project, is OK.

## Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:
* Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
* Prefer readability over dogma.
* Keep to the existing formatting.
* Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
* Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.
